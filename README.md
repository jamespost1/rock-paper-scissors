# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple command-line implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors built in **vanilla JavaScript** as part of [The Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).  
This project demonstrates core JavaScript logic, functions, conditionals, and randomization without any external libraries.

---

## Overview

The goal of this phase was to build the complete game logic for Rock Paper Scissors that runs in the browser console.  
It allows the player to play multiple rounds against a computer opponent that makes random choices. The winner of each round and the overall score are displayed in the console.

This version focuses on:
- Clean, readable JavaScript.
- Proper function structure and return values.
- Handling user input via `prompt()` (or pre-set test cases).
- Score tracking and conditional logic for determining outcomes.

---

## Features

- Player vs Computer rounds.
- Randomized computer choice each round.
- Input validation (ignores invalid entries).
- Score tracking over five rounds (configurable).
- Displays round results and final winner in the console.

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** (minimal placeholder file)  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — logic and interaction  
- **No CSS or UI** (console-based version)

---

## What I Learned

- How to structure functions for clarity and reusability.
- Importance of handling user input and validation.
- Using conditionals and random number generation for game logic.
- Basic debugging and testing in the browser console.
- Breaking a problem into smaller, testable parts.

## Planned Phase 2: GUI Version

**Next step** will be upgrading this console game to a fully interactive GUI version using DOM manipulation.

Planned updates:
- Replace console input/output with clickable buttons.
- Display player and computer choices visually.
- Show ongoing score and round results on-screen.
- Add basic styling with CSS (responsive layout).
- Optional enhancements:
  - Animation for wins/losses.
  - Restart/reset button.
  - Persistent score tracking with `localStorage`.

---

## Future Improvements

After the GUI phase:
- Add sound effects and transitions.
- Create a “best of” match mode.
- Track session stats and display summaries.
- Improve accessibility (keyboard controls, focus states).
