# Rock Paper Scissors ‚Äì Browser UI Version

A simple **interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built in **vanilla JavaScript** as part of [The Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).  
This version replaces the command-line interface with a **clickable UI**, showing round results, live score, and fun emoji-based buttons.

- Players click one of the three emoji buttons (‚úä Rock, ‚úã Paper, ‚úåÔ∏è Scissors).  
- The computer makes a random choice each round.  
- Round results are displayed below the buttons.
